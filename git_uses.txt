# Verifying email and credentials in Git

# To view the email configured in Git in your local repository, 
# use the following command:
$ git config user.email

# This will display the email you have configured for Git.

# To verify the credentials configured in Git in your local 
# repository, use the following command:
$ git config credential.helper

# This will display the type of credential helper you have 
# configured. Depending on the helper you use, you can view the 
# credentials using different commands.

# For example, if you use Git's credential caching helper, you can 
# view the cached credentials using the following command:
$ git credential-cache get

# This will display the cached credentials, including the username 
# and access token.

# If you do not remember the credentials you have configured, you can 
# reset them by following these steps:

# 1. Change the email configured in Git:
$ git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"

# This command changes the email configured in Git to 
# your_email@example.com.

# 2. Remove the cached credentials:
$ git credential-cache erase

# This command removes the cached credentials on your system.

# After resetting the credentials, you will need to log in again to 
# the remote repository the next time you perform an operation that 
# requires authentication.
